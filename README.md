An ascii DOOMish renderer entirely in the terminal.  Does not play as a game, but it does run. It is possible to rotate about the axis on keypress. Changes of positions in code allow for resizing of objects for depth-perception relative to the player.  Kind of abandonware right now, but just thought I'd post it in case I work on it in the future.
